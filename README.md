# NASA Astronomical Picture of the Day (APOD)

A simple Flutter Application that shows a list of Astronomical Pictures from [NASA APOD API](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) 🚀🛰

## Getting Started
Make sure you grab the *API KEY* from [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/).
<br>After you have obtained the api key.
Create a new file called `api_key.json` in `assets/` directory.
<br>
Copy & paste the following lines into it and make sure to **replace** the key with your **API_KEY**
```
{
    "key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```
From here onwards its pretty straight forward. Just `cd` into the directory and run `flutter run` to run the app on your emulator/device.
